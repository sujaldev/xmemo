        Xmemo allows you access to an organised database of notes and resources you might need specific to Xavierians.
        <br>For Computer Science Programs you can search for notes by date or by keywords in the question,
        and there you have an answer,
        possibly multiple answers uploaded by different people or even the same person.
        You can also see below every answer how many people though of that answer to be correct and how many thought it
        wasn't correct, so you are getting reliable answers.<br><br>

        <bold>Please note any type of notes other CS Programs is currently not supported, working on this feature.</bold>
